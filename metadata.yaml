description: What does it mean to be popular? Is it a mark of good character, or merely
  a sign that you're well-regarded among an influential group of elites? The hero
  in Booth Tarkington's tale The Conquest of Canaan has achieved a strange kind of
  popularity -- he's seen as a prince among those who are down on their luck, but
  to the upper classes and the powerful, he might as well be invisible. Will Joe Loudon
  be able to channel his limited influence to make some much-needed changes in his
  community?
